## Introduction

This is my first version of my personal website for presenting myself as a Full-Stack Web Developer. I decided for a minimal design with two colors and little distraction. This will be improved and changed as I go along my journey as a developer.

## Features

- About me section
- Projects section with most recent projects
- Contact section

## Build Process

- started building the design in Figma for desktop and mobile
- used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS only
- I built the HTML skeleton first, filled with content
- applied styling with Bootstrap and custom CSS
- once I was happy with the layout I started implementing little bits of JavaScript
